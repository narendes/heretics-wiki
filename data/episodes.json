    "synopsis": "Five teenagers in Oakville, Missouri experience unnatural portents during Christmas, 1990.",
    "recap": "December 21, 1990:\nTwas the last day of school before Christmas, and all through North End, a strange magic was stirring, and it was no friend.\n\nDespite the trouble to come, the high school’s pep rally was full of relieved and anticipatory energy–the students were ready for the break from early mornings, loads of homework, and all the other social, academic, and athletic pressures of school. Not to mention the unseasonably warm weather of 60 F and sunny (though that would soon change). But bad things come in threes: 1) Starting with the toppling of the cheerleaders’ pyramid that resulted in injuries and bad blood. 2) Local goth girl, Ash, dreamt of an ominous cavern in a frozen swamp that beckoned a three-antlered deer inside it’s gaping mouth, only for the deer to convulse and bolt away, then die on the swamp’s shores in a decomposed, foamy mess. And 3) The weather on the night of December 21st, 1990, dropped from 60 F to 0 F in a matter of hours. And the city of St. Louis wouldn’t get a reprieve from the snow flurries that followed for some time yet.\n\nDecember 25, 1990:\nIt’s Christmas morning, and we begin with junior and go-getter Michelle, who shields her adorable little bro, Stevie, from their parents’ argument which her dad eventually wins. To the church of dad’s choice (Methodist) they go where Michelle helps out the pastor a little too much and gives a poorly received thirty-one minute sermon. After the service, her bff Sarah tells her it’s okay, but Michelle spends the rest of Christmas with her confidence worse for the wear.\n\nOur next party member, Emerson (also a junior), wakes up that morning and immediately feeds her beloved tarantula before going downstairs to open presents with her enthusiastic parents (though she is primarily a daddy’s girl), and receives a shortwave radio that she is over the moon for. Her brother Dean storms downstairs, in a mood as ever, and finds literal coal at the bottom of his stocking. Em, of course, gives everyone in her family a thoughtful gift and they then go to the Methodist church to sit through the painful sermon from Michelle. But what Em really wants to do is play with her new radio, which she needs to first study up on. The library is closed, and when Em tries to break in, she’s caught by a cop who sends her home. Though she is dejected, her determination remains to get this WWII radio working, and she manages to catch a frequency with voices speaking a language unrecognizable to her, but which her dad claims is Bosk. \n\nCut to a jock with senioritis made infinitely worse by the fact that his girlfriend of seven years broke up with him a couple weeks ago. Nick’s loving mother forces him out of his room that he has camped in for three days and he decides to run it off, and oh, may as well just run by his ex’s place. Shockingly, that backfires when she and her father see him outside their front window as they celebrate the holiday with their family (and hot chocolate burns ensue). Nick and his mom go to the grocery for fish curry ingredients, and he sees a strange shadow-like figure loom behind their car, but no one else sees it. He later turns to his buddies, Dean and Chad, for comfort. Though Dean abandons them for his girlfriend who we will soon meet, Chad and Nick play catch in the snow, which ends very badly as Chad reveals that he is seeing Nick’s ex. In an amazing feat of human strength, Chad proceeds to crush the baseball Nick throws at him in a rage.\n\nBut it’s not all negativity here as we meet our most bubbly party member, Hannah, who painstakingly crafts cards for her teammates injured in the cheerleading tower topple, and ehem, it may have been Hannah’s fault. She gives her overly doting parents their own Christmas cards before they head off to church and witness a family scandal that we’ll get to in a minute. Hannah notices that her bff/Nick’s ex, Jess, is eyeing Chad. The bffs hang out before Hannah delivers the get well cards to two teammates, one of which accepts the mis-rhymed card, and the other who literally shoves Hannah back out her front door. Hannah then eats with Jess’s family before spending the rest of the evening with her boyfriend, and Em’s big bro, Dean.\n\nThe final member of our party really tried to rally herself for Christmas this year, knowing her mom and brother would be insufferably cheerful and her dad indifferent. But those creepy nightmares about the dark cave, the frozen swamp, and the rotting deer have gotten to her, and when her mom gifts her a dress to rival Cinderella’s but worse, pink, Ash decides she can’t play nice like she thought she could. Ash also takes a mysterious gold-wrapped present from under the tree that doesn’t belong to anyone else. She proceeds to make the dress more her style by cutting it, safety pinning it, and covering most of the pink with black sharpie. Her family doesn’t see the redesign until they’re at the Catholic church, and boy does Lisa throw a hissy fit. Ash’s mom then forcefeeds her communion (and ruins her new dress), and Ash is condemned to her room for the rest of Christmas, which she doesn’t mind at all. She opens the golden gift and finds tarot cards inside, they’re heavy and in a language she doesn’t recognize. She pulls a card and feels an immediate sense of dread as she sees pictured on it an individual being tortured by the soldiers surrounding them. \n\nAnd so, Christmas ends with nothing in sight but bad omens, strange happenings, and the promise of raging NYE parties where the high school drama may just reach its height…\n",

    "author": "Tori Simpson",
    "synopsis": "Nick has a disturbing dream about Chad, while tensions erupt at the weird kids' New Year's Eve party.",
    "recap": "It was a dark and snowy night, with a sky tinged red. Nick wakes in the wood to a vignetted scene and sees a tattered bundle of blankets behind him from which a baby’s wails echo out. He rushes to pick up the baby with dark olive skin and pointed ears. Despite the peaceful snowfall, the baby’s mouth, eyes, and other orifices start foaming reddish crusty liquid that startles Nick into dropping the baby. He runs away and reaches a pond that reflects back at him the blackened, armored figure that he glimpsed behind his car, and it too begins to foam red before removing its helmet to reveal Chad’s face beneath. Nick awakens for real this time to see deep snow and kids playing outside through his bedroom window. When his mom checks on him, all he can say is “Creepy baby!” Nick recovers fairly quickly and calls up the team and adjacent friends for a NYE pregame where the dresscode is black tie hopeful but varsity jacket reality. Drama ensues behind whispers and pointed looks as the cool kids begin their celebrations.\n\nSpeaking of cool kids, Hannah is feeling slightly uncool, possibly for the first time ever. Her teammates are unhappy with the pyramid fiasco, which drives Hannah to dedicate herself to the delicate craft of cheerleading harder than ever. Dean doesn’t quite answer correctly when Hannah asks him if he’d still love her if she was a worm, but at least he still would if she wasn’t a cheerleader–or would he? After an awkward dinner with Hannah, her parents, and Dean, the latter wins back some points after police captain dad sees the pristine condition of his red 1988 Chevy Camaro… eye roll. All at the dinner party are relieved when it’s time for Hannah and Dean to go to the NYE pregame.\n\nMeanwhile, Ash spends the several days between Christmas and New Years walking the cemetery, reading tarot cards, and watching bad movies with her dad. April and Roberta, juniors who adore Ash, invite her to a different NYE party at a kid named Carlos’ place, which she gladly sneaks out to attend. Before she leaves for the party, she tries out her mystery tarot cards once more and feels a chill to her bones that has nothing to do with the cold weather when she once more pulls the same card displaying an individual being tortured by the soldiers surrounding them. She shakes off the ever present feeling of dread and tucks the cards away before the party–she’ll take her safer deck this time. While sneaking out, she also catches her brother, Chad, doing the same, and they share a rare heart to heart that sparks some affection in Ash–though she still loves to hate him, the love is beginning to win out against the teenage contrariness.\n\nIn the time in between, Em has been absorbed in her new radio, and frequents the town’s libraries to try and figure out the strange language emanating from its waves. That and, naturally, taking attentive care of her beloved insects and arachnids. Em drives Pat (who is feeling rather left out for not getting a bespoke mixtape from Em like Anna does, especially since he carved a knife for Em as her holiday gift) and Anna to the nerd and theater kid party, also securing a safe space at Carlos’ for the beloved comfort tarantula, Agent Orange. \n\nAt Carlos’ the classic game of Truth or Dare commences, revealing a little too much of people, and though the night successfully unites two of our party members as newfound friends, Em and Ash, other relationships crumble as insults about class and sexuality are aired. Agent Orange definitely came out as the winner of the popular vote at the un-popular party. \n\nThings at Carlos’ party could have been better, but they also could have been worse. That’s more than can be said for what’s sure to be an even more drama-filled party of the high school’s top dogs. \n",

    "synopsis": "The teens uncover definitive evidence of the occult through radio transmissions and an ominous standoff.",
    "recap": "December 27, 1990:\n\nThere is no greater act of friendship than bringing gallons of oatmeal through the cold and snow to your best friend who is living in a house plagued by chicken pox. Sarah is a real one, and Michelle is ever grateful for her trusty VP. Though Michelle spends the wayward days between Christmas and New Years stuck at home with her itchy little brother, she’s rewarded by going to the cool kid’s NYE party with Michelle to start getting her name out there among the movers and shakers of suburban St. Louis. \n\nDecember 31, 1990:\n\nDean drives Hannah and Jess (in style and already high) to Jess’ house to prepare for the big bash. More and more of the high school’s elite pour through the doors of the McMansion, but the party doesn’t really start until 10pm when the football team shows up fashionably late Entourage-style, organized by our adventurer Nick who gives a rallying speech worthy of the battlefield (and this may just be one). As the partygoers start stretching their social muscles, some more effectively than others, Hannah comes across two enemies–one, a be-braced girl with an atrocious perm, the other, her teammate whose arm she accidentally broke during the pyramid tumble. To take the edge off, Dean, Ben, Hannah, and Nick take a tab of acid–and Dean takes three. \n\nMore cold shoulders and giddy embraces ensue during the party’s kick-off, while Sarah and Michelle stand alone in a secluded corner cooking up a plan on how to work the crowd, that is, until StuCo Prez and Bball Captain Christopher Yoon exchanges blows in the form of cutting words with a more than prepared Michelle. Move aside, Chris, Michelle has a 10 step plan to become the POTUS, and it starts tonight. And her first opportunity to win over some new constituents comes in the form of beer pong.\n\nAt the encouragement of dear Sarah, Michelle plays some beer pong for the first time in her life and does win over the hearts of Hannah, Nick, and an increasingly tripping Dean. But though beer pong scores many points for “guardian angel” Michelle, Nick and Hannah play pong well, but not so much their social cards, and high school reporter Kenny Quick lives up to his name and captures all the drama. Not the least of which being that Jess has not heard from her newish boyfriend Chad for days and is very upset and confused, but Hannah remains steadfast in her support and encouragement. Though she does accidentally start a rumor that Jess is pregnant when Nick starts talking about a creepy baby, which Kenny picks up on. Nick is beginning to spiral, so sober “guardian angel” Michelle decides to drive Sarah, Nick, Hannah, and Dean home in the bone-chilling cold.\n\nAfter the witching hour has passed, drama of a different, darker kind stretches its limbs at the nerd party. Ash does tarot on as many of her peers as possible (luckily there is no shortage of people who want their fate read), keeping a close eye out for BLANK, but it never shows its dread-inducing face. Me, meanwhile, is quite tipsy, and as she sways to the rock music, she can’t help but spill to her friends about the radio with the strange language riding its waves. In an adventurous spirit, they decide to go back to Em’s and give it a listen, and Em brings her newfound friend, Ash, along. Ash drives them as the least drunk person there, and then the four friends gather in Em’s room. Pat and Anna have a knack for languages, and when an announcer starts speaking, they confirm that the language is Arabic and all wonder how this radio is picking up a signal across the world. Em turns to another channel and static crackles, punctuated by the raspy, hushed voice of what seems to be an old man frantically repeating the words “amal rotha”. The voice breaks as it increases in volume and desperation, and suddenly, it cuts off, leaving behind only the haunting sound of static. The teens look at each other in fear and unsettlement as the static persists. Pat, the most visibly shaken, confirms that that was not Arabic, and it was unlike anything he’s ever heard. Ash, too, is disturbed, knowing instinctively that this is the language on her mystery tarot card deck—but she tries to keep her cool even as she calmly insists to an intrigued and notably less bothered Em that she needs to go home immediately to consult her cards.  Em writes her number on Ash’s arm insisting that she call tomorrow, and has her cool dad drive Ash home. When Ash arrives home undetected she is unable to sleep and eventually works up the courage to draw from the deck, coming up with that same omen again and again. The dread causes her to dry heave and she takes a shower to wash off the feeling—spoiler alert, it doesn’t work. She’s lying restless in bed when the phone rings, and thinking it’s a sign, Ash picks it up to hear a voice she didn’t expect, Jess. Jess asks where Chad is, to which Ash sassily answers that she thought he’d be with her. He is not, and when Ash checks his room and finds it empty, she can’t help but think this is all connected. Well, she’s not wrong…\n\nAs Michelle drives everyone home, a darkness darker than the night stands starkly against the snowy road. She calls her friends’ attention to it, and Nick tries to gulp back his fear as he realizes that it’s the armored figure from his nightmares, asleep and now waking. Michelle taps the brakes (ever practical and in control), but Nick decides to get out of the car with his steel bat, challenging who only he thinks is Chad, to which everyone screams at him to get back in because this is a bad idea. He shockingly doesn’t, and when the car slips it bumps into Nick and pushes him into the shadowy entity, it grabs his shoulders, and says “tabaxi”. Nick stares up, horrified, but it simply dissipates into gray dust blown away by the winter wind. The teens are in terror, and they pull Nick back in and quickly drive to Dean’s house and hole up in the basement together, too scared to separate after some good ol’ trauma bonding. Nick notices a stain of red foam-ish substance on his shirt, and knows this isn’t over. \n\nJanuary 1, 1991:\n\nAsh’s nightmare isn’t over either, for she’s woken from a fitful sleep by a pounding on her door. Her mother bursts in, saying Chad is missing, and for once biting back sarcastic comebacks, a deathly worried Ash scrambles out of bed to find out what happened to her brother.\n",

    "synopsis": "The new year dawns, revealing that a popular football player has gone missing.",
    "recap": "January 1, 1991:\nTwo may be a coincidence, but three is a pattern, and now our third party member is plagued by a foreboding nightmare. Green, frozen darkness. Limbs flailing and grabbing at her. Hannah is shoved through the iced over surface by gnarly hands beneath her and emerges atop a frozen lake; on the horizon is a red-tinged sky. Ring a bell?\n\nThe usually cheerful cheerleader wakes in Dean’s basement among the others, sobbing, and rushes to the bathroom. Chaos and confusion ensue in the basement as Nick, Dean, and Michelle also get up (Nick not having slept at all) and start questioning whether LSD is contagious. Who knows? None of them do. They decide they need to find Chad and head upstairs to a full kitchen. Em, Pat, and Anna are with the parents in the kitchen, and while the cool kids hide the full truth from Em, they tell her that they’re going to help look for Chad and Em says they should bring in Ash. \n\nAsh knows her parents are overbearing and often overreact, but she has an awful feeling that Chad is really in trouble this time, even though he hasn’t technically been gone that long. They tell her to stay in the house while they go out to look for their golden child, but she calls Em to pick her up so they can do some sleuthing of their own. Em and Ash head the designated meetup place, Jess’s, while the others go pick up the cars they left around town. They stop by the spot where they saw the dark knight, but besides some red droplets in the snow there is no evidence. Hannah picks up some of the red foamy substance in her jacket just in case. While the jocks and presidential hopefuls are doing that, Em and Ash decide to ask Jess themselves, against their better judgment. Unsurprisingly, Ash and Jess do not get along and no progress is made. Hannah does damage control when the other teens arrive and stays with Jess through her very difficult time.\n\nAsh and Em wait dejected in the car and Ash has Em pull from the mystery tarot deck; Em pulls blank cards over and over, and Ash pulls a cherub with olive skin and wings flying with red sky behind it and it has a red fingerprint. Ash has no clue what this means and the blanks are a strange occurrence, but she knows something important or impossible has happened. Dean, Nick, and Michelle still don’t admit the full story to Ash and Em, but they do make a concerted effort to spread out and look for Chad. During the search, the kids finally connect that a few of them have been having similar dreams with different bad omens, and are now all on the same page.\n\nJanuary 2-last day of winter break 1991:\n\nSadly, enough time passes that the police do have to get involved, and each of the kids get questioned to no avail. Ash arrived home to a hysterically distraught mother who puts her on couch-arrest for the remainder of break for sneaking out when her brother is missing (Lisa reported Ash missing as well, prematurely). We finally meet coach, who takes this stuff seriously and even goes so far as to offer his players (teenagers, might I add) guns in case they need to protect themselves. His beloved German Shepherd, Nancy, also joins in the hunt, but Chad’s trail has run cold. Em gives each of them walkie talkies to stay in touch throughout the rest of winter break. Em gathers books on many topics from tarot cards to ancient languages to semiotic. She delivers some of the books to home-bound Ash and to Nick, who also becomes obsessed with his dream and the dread that has become nearly and increasingly unbearable.\n\nAs the new semester approaches, each adventurer does their own part to either continue to search for Chad or investigate the strange occurrences that have been happening. Ash willingly goes to church for the first time after pulling a tarot card with a priest on it, but finds nothing at the Catholic church. Michelle’s family have gotten into the mega-church broadcast and the congregation prays for Chad on live TV, and her little brother tells her about a new friend in a giant rat that crawled in through his bedroom window, but she brushes it off as his active imagination (though, you can never be too careful these days). The night before school starts, Nick’s anxiety has reached a breaking point. His mom knocks on his door to check on him and leaves him to get some sleep. Then, another knock sounds on his door–before he can answer, it slowly creaks open and metal steps reverberate on the floor. The dark knight stands before him, and Nick is quaking in the corner of his room holding his trusty baseball bat. Nick asks what the armored figure did to Chad, and it answers that it didn’t do anything to the demon. It then removes its helmet to reveal a face with dark green skin, pointy ears, and tusks on either side of its mouth to tell Nick that if he doesn’t want to end up like the demon he needs to come with. Nick simply asks, “Go where?” \n\nAnd then there were two missing teenage boys in smalltown Oakville…\n",

    "recap": "First Day of Spring Semester: January 7, 1991:\n\nIf three is a pattern, four is a damning certainty. In dreams, Em stargazes under a purple sky and sees a mountain range in the distance. As she walks towards it, pebbles shift behind her to reveal a sinister canine-like creature that attacks her with teeth and claw. More join the bloodthirsty frenzy and Em is being torn apart until a giant mechanical arachnid sprays the beasts with a blue glue-like substance that scares them off. The gargantuan spider covers Em with its webbing that heals her wounds, and she feels a sense of comfort before she wakes and immediately jots down her nightmare. Despite being very thrown by the vivid experience, Em heads to her first day of the spring semester, shaken but prepared as ever when she checks in with the rest of our party using her trusty radio. Well, the rest of the party except for Nick…\n\nEm begins her day at school in the activities office, where she aids Mr. Smith in prepping the morning announcements while Michelle delivers them to the school with Sarah’s help. Among other things, the student body is told to keep the missing Chad Higdon in their prayers. Ash prepared for the attention to be more on her than usual, and does her utmost to look unapproachable and standoffish, which she’s already pretty good at. Hannah uses another tactic to prepare for what’s bound to be a crazy semester by doing jazzercise videos before school to drown out the fear. The rest of the school, though not having been privy to the events of the holiday break, also feels tense and on edge with Chad’s disappearance. Ash largely makes it through her classes without anything unusual happening, that is, until she gets an undeniable sense of familiarity between her mysterious tarot deck and Ms. Poe’s Hawaiian-shirted chinchilla, Applebee. More on that later. \n\nThroughout the day, Chad’s absence is very noted, though our adventurers try to remain calm. Luckily, there is a StuCo meeting after school that provides a welcome distraction for Michelle and Hannah. After much debate, the important decision of where prom will be held is made: the botanical garden (on 4/20, much to Dean’s chagrin). Em and Ash have their own after-school endeavors as well; Em, to study the red foamy substance left behind by the dark night using the school’s chemistry equipment, and Ash, to get a better read on Ms. Poe and her class pet in relation to the tarot cards. Em doesn’t make much leeway, though Ms. Jones’ interest is certainly piqued. Ash confirms that Ms. Poe definitely knows more than she’s letting on about this supernatural conundrum, especially with how interested she is in the tarot cards that she claims to know nothing about, but Ash can come to no definitive conclusion about the beloved literature teacher. Em and Ash then hang out at Em’s place and go over the dubious Ms. Poe, and Em excitedly tells Ash about her visceral nightmare. They test the radio, but there is nothing new to be heard there, and when Ash decides to head home, Dean is arriving. He pulls his sister aside to let her know that Nick is missing too, now. Word spreads fast, and the ever polite Hannah goes to check on Nick’s parents and check out his room. She finds nothing helpful save the radio given to him by Em and pockets it. \n\nThe kids are more confused than ever as they try to put together clues from tarot cards, strange dreams, radio signals, foreign substances, and a cute chinchilla, not to mention two missing teenage boys. After day one, they all know that it’s going to be a long semester.\n",

    "recap": "January 7, 1991:\n\nAfter a long first day back at school, Hannah gets home in much lower spirits than she’s used to. It’s dark and cold outside, and her phone rings. She answers it to hear heavy breathing… but it’s just Dean freaking out that two of his close friends and teammates are now missing, and he thinks he’s next. Hannah rushes over to Dean’s to comfort him, and does, but she also runs across Em and trades some information, books, and keeps Nick’s walkie talkie so she can stay in touch with the rest of the party (her code name is Glitter). Hannah tells Em to take care of her distraught older brother, which Em takes too much to heart and ends up triggering the trap she set up to protect Dean. The cops, including Hannah’s dad, come to question Dean before school the next morning, but find he doesn’t know anything (or anything that they’d believe, at least). The police question the rest of the baseball and football players as well as the coach who has started a manhunt of his own to look for Chad and Nick.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the energy at school is still bad, and Ash wonders how she’s going to make it through another day of stares and whispers. One person who’s not bothering to whisper is Kenny Quick, who asks Ash if she thinks Nick killed Chad and dipped. Luckily, Jason and Ms. Poe come to her aid, not that she needed it, and Ash is relieved that Ms. Poe doesn’t seem to have changed in reaction to the tarot card incident from the previous day, yet…\n\nCut to one of the worst places on Earth, the high school cafeteria. The nerds are still divided after the NYE drama where blows in the form of cutting words were exchanged, so Em and Ash sit by themselves–they have enough drama to deal with. And an epic showdown between Michelle and Chris ensues when the future POTUS disproves Nigel’s claims that Chris did all the planning for prom. \n\nThe next step in the plan comes in the form of Em startling Ms. Po before class by shouting “amal rotha” at her. She is visibly shaken, and keeps glancing sharply at Applebee, especially when Em asks whether there are tabaxis in the story of Beowulf. Po clearly knows something about the tarot cards which she is not disclosing, and when Em shows her the red foam she looks very scared. She says she is frightened and sad for the missing students, and Em makes a mental note to follow up on this tomorrow at Animal Club.\n\nAfter another fraught day, the kids decide to meet at Hannah’s after school to discuss further. They focus heavily on the tarot cards, and along with finding out the Ms. Po has pointed ears, some of the characters on the cards look like her. Ash also pulls past, present, and future readings for each of the party members, Nick, Chad, Ms. Po, and Dean. Please consult the notes I sent in the Discord for more details. Hannah’s mom interrupts the witchy meeting to call for dinner, and Em and Ash leave. Michelle stays over, though, as she and Hannah have become surprisingly close of late. But Michelle is not the most out of place thing at dinner that night–Hannah finds herself repulsed by the cod which is usually a favorite of hers.\n\nEm and Ash go to their own homes and do their normal routine of checking the radio and the cards respectively, and Michelle goes home as well to finish her homework. Michelle prefers a solid night’s sleep each school night, but she is awoken much earlier than usual the next morning when piercing screams resound from Stevie’s room. Michelle rushes to her little brother, as do their parents. He had a nightmare about his grandfather dying as he laid prone with red stuff seeping from his mouth, and apparently Michelle was in the dream too and didn’t do anything about it. She’s worried for her brother, but eventually chalks it up to possible carbon monoxide poisoning. For some people, not even seeing is believing…\n",
